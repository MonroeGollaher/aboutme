        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Monroe Gollaher. I was born and raised here in Boise, ID. I initially went to Boise State for a major in elementary education, but tech has always been a passion of mine; as has creative endeavors like photography and music.</p>
        <p>After really getting into photography I wanted to create my own website and didn't want to deal with hosting sites like Wix, etc. I soon became enamored with coding. It combined two areas I love into one; creativity and tech, as well as problem solving.</p>
